1.Question 1
A test for “driving while intoxicated” was given 100 times. 20 people tested were actually intoxicated, and 10 people were mis-classified as intoxicated. What would the False Positive rate be?
1 / 1 point


30%


10%


50%


12.5% *

Correct
Correct. There are 10 False Positives and (100 – 20) = 80 people had Condition Negative. The False Positive rate is 10 divided by 80.

2.Question 2
If a fire alarm malfunctions and fails to go off when there actually is a fire, that is a:
1 / 1 point


True Positive


True Negative


False Positive


False Negative *

3.Question 3
Use the Binary Classification Metrics Spreadsheet Definitions to answer the following:

If the “classification incidence/test incidence” is 10% for the whole population, and the true “condition incidence” is 12% for the whole population, the True Positive rate:
1 / 1 point


must be 0%


must be 100%


cannot be 100% *


can be 100%


4.Question 4
Use the Cancer Diagnosis Spreadsheet to answer Questions 4 to 6.

Keep the cost per False Positive test set at $500. Use MS Solver to determine the maximum cost per False Negative test that permits an average cost per test of $100.

$17,082


$12,262 *

5.Question 5
Assume a cost of $15,000 per False Negative (FN) and $100 per False Positive (FP). What is the minimum average cost per test?
1 / 1 point


$25.98 *


$259,800


$16,551


$1.00

6.Question 6
If, instead of assuming a cost $15,000 per FN and $100 per FP, the costs are assumed to be $7,500 per FN and $50 per FP, what changes?
1 / 1 point


The minimum Cost per Test *


The False Positive Rate


The True Positive Rate


The minimum cost threshold of 16,551.930

Correct
Correct. The minimum cost per test changes from $25.98 to $12.99.


7.Question 7
Use logic and the definition in the Binary Performance Metrics Spreadsheet to answer the following question.

Binary Performance Metrics.xlsx
In general, increasing the cost per FN while keeping the cost per FP constant will cause the cost-minimizing threshold score to:
1 / 1 point


Increase


Decrease *


Stay the Same

8.Question 8
Make a copy of the Bombers and Seagulls Spreadsheet to answer questions 8-10.

Bombers and Seagulls.xlsx
Modify the spreadsheet data so that there are 4 bombers instead of 3, and 16 seagulls instead of 17, by changing the actual condition for the radar score of 66 from a 0 to a 1 in cell D43.

What is the new Area Under the Curve:

0.72


0.78


0.824



Increases by 950,000 pounds


Unknown


Increases by 5 million pounds.


Increases by 250,000 pounds *


10.Question 10
Change the cost per FN to 50 million pounds. How does changing the data in cell D43 from a 0 to a 1 change the cost-minimizing threshold?
1 / 1 point


Decreases it from 75 to 66. *


Decreases it from 75 to 70


Increases it from 66 to 75.


Decreases it from 75 to 62


11.Question 11
Use the Binary Performance Metrics Spreadsheet definitions to answer the following question.

Binary Performance Metrics.xlsx
A population tested for “driving while intoxicated” has a Condition incidence of 20%. If the test has a true positive rate of 70% and a false positive rate of 10%, what is the test’s Positive Predictive Value (PPV)?
1 / 1 point


0.36


0.50


0.64 *


0.60

Correct
Great job! The Positive Predictive Value is e/c. We know e = .7*.2 = .14 We know g = .1*(1-.2) = .08. We know c is the sum of e and g.
12.Question 12
Use the Soldier Performance Spreadsheet to answer question 12.

Forecasting Soldier Performance.xlsx
Rank the outcomes using soldier’s age as the score, with the oldest at the top. A threshold of 24 years represents what point on the ROC Curve?
1 / 1 point


.5, .5


.33, .67 *


.67, .33


.25, .75

Correct
Each (x,y) point on the ROC Curve is a False Positive rate and a True Positive rate. Divide the number of 0s above the threshold (4) by 6 (condition negatives) to get the False Positive rate and the number of 1s above the threshold (2) by 6 (condition positives) to get the True Positive rate.
