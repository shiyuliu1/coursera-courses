# Part 2
1.Question 1
Introduction

Part 2 is intended to illustrate how binary classification performance metrics make it possible for you to put an exact value, in dollars per event, on new information that relates to a predictive model.

Note that new information will be worth far more if it is compared to no forecasting model rather than the state of partial knowledge available from the current model. Sellers of information (and data science consultants!) love to take credit for any information gain they achieve over the base rate.

Very often some intermediate state of knowledge is already available for which no additional spending is required. Evaluating the realistic incremental financial gain from new information, whether licensing a third-party commercial database or collecting new data internally, is therefore of great practical value, as this sets an upper bound on what your Company should be willing to pay to license or create the new information.

In this case study, your boss has been in discussions with an advanced machine-learning predictive-analytics credit-risk analytics company that claims to score individual probability of default with very high information gain. Let’s call the company Eggertopia. Eggertopia sales representatives claim their pre-processed risk-scores can achieve AUC values as high as .85 or even higher. However, Eggertopia scores are sold per-event, and they are expensive!

Your boss asks you to determine the incremental financial value to the bank of purchasing Eggertopia risk scores on future credit-card applicants.

Eggertopia agrees to apply its algorithms to generate credit scores for the 400 individuals in the Training and Test Sets. Eggertopia scores do not need to be combined with anything else to make a model. However, since the scores range from approximately -600 (best credit risk) to 4900 (most likely to default) they will need to be standardized and adjusted to fit the -3.5 to 3.5 range of the AUC Calculator Spreadsheet (below)

AUC_Calculator and Review of AUC Curve.xlsx
You will determine the sustainable AUC of the Eggertopia scores, the sustainable cost-per-event, and the savings per event, when comparing Eggertopia data to the base rate forecast.

You will then calculate the incremental savings per event if you compare use of Eggertopia data to use of your current model developed in Part 1.

# Part 4

1.Question 1
Modeling Profitability Instead of Default

Modeling Profitability Level as a Continuous Output (Instead of Binary Classification Default/No Default)

Introduction

Both your own model and the forecast based on Eggertopia scores are binary classifications: they forecast one of just two outcomes: “Default” or “No Default.” Your boss is interested in the idea that it might be preferable instead to model and forecast profits and losses as continuous values, using a a multivariate linear regression model on the same six input variables. This idea has arisen because the bank has been reviewing individual profit and loss numbers for each customer over the three-year period and has made an interesting discovery: some defaulting customers carried so much debt for so long, and paid so much interest on it, that they were profitable for the bank even though they defaulted! Many customers who seem to have risky spending behaviors are also among the most profitable for a lending business. And, at the opposite extreme,customers who always paid off their cards in full each month never defaulted but were not very profitable: the bank barely broke even, or even lost money, on its“safest” borrowers.

Your boss asks you to forecast each applicant’s expected profitability, in dollars,before deciding whether or not to issue them a credit card. He wants to know how reliable this type of forecast would be: what is the range above and below the point estimate that will be correct 90% of the time?

Although it might be possible to combine the six inputs in other ways, in the interests of time and focusing on the key learning objectives, we will use only a simple linear combination of the six input variables for Part 4 of this Project. (You should not include the Eggertopia Scores as an input variable).

Question 1 is about the coefficients or “betas” used to combine the standardized inputs to get the best-fit-line on standardized outputs on the Training Set. We then use those fixed betas to measure the observed residual error of the model on the Test Set.

Questions 2 through 6 concern the forecasts on the Test Set.

Questions 7 through 11 look at the Training Set results so that they can be compared (for possible over-fitting) against the Test Set Results.

Questions 12 through 14 are about the uncertainty that remains in a new individual forecast of profitability.

Use the Excel “Linest” function on the six inputs and profitability output on the 200 Training Set applicants to calculate the coefficients (the “betas”) that result in the best-fit line.

Incorrect
The PIG is equal to the mutual information, divided by the entropy of the standardized output variable. The mutual information for Gaussians is equal to (–log2(standard deviation of error on standardized data)) The standardized output variable is also a Gaussian, with standard deviation = 1, and that has entropy = 2.05 bits. The correct answer, -log2(standard deviation of error)/2.05, should appear in [Cell Y14].

Questions 13 through 15 use the same example applicant.

The following data are known about the sample applicant:

Age: 42.00

Years at Employer: 12.44

Years at Address: 0.9

Income: $121,400

CC debt: -34,228

Auto debt: -23,411

To convert above inputs to standardized form, locate the Training Set Spreadsheet (first bottom tab of workbook) in the Data for Final Project Workbook.

Data_for_Final_Project.xlsx
Use the input means [Cells C207:H207] and standard deviations [Cells C209:H209].

Use the Training Set profitability mean [$1,905.51] and standard deviation [$5755.91] from the Profit and Loss (last bottom tab) Spreadsheet.

Use the Test Set standard deviation of error on standardized outputs of .6750

Question: What is the point estimate of profitability, in dollars?
1 / 1 point


$11,109.61


$8,451.61


-$10,683.61


$10,683.61 *

Correct
Standardize each input variable separately, using the appropriate mean and standard deviation from the Data for Final Project Workbook [mean, cells C207:H207 and standard deviation, cells C209:H209].

Then multiply each individual z-score by its “beta” coefficient from the original Excel “Linest” Calculation on the (standardized) Training Set.

Then sum the results. That sum is the point forecast of profitability, expressed as a standardized output (z-score). The correct z-score estimate for y = 1.525059.

Multiply the z-score by the standard deviation of profits ($5755.91), then add the mean profit ($1,905.51). You should get $10,683.61.


14.Question 14
The following data are known about the sample applicant:

Age: 42.00

Years at Employer: 12.44

Question: With 50% confidence, what is the range of profitability?
1 / 1 point


Range from $12,962.61 to $10,683.61


Range from $10,683.61 to – $2,278.99


Range from $11,823.28 to $9,543.94


Range from $13,304.16 to $8,063.06. *

Correct
The mean of the interval is $10,683.61 (from Question 13).

This is a left-sided 25% confidence interval.

The normsinv(p = .25) = -0.67448975.

The interval from p= .25 to p = .75 is +- plus or minus

(the standard deviation of error as a fraction of the standard deviation of profitability)*(normsinv(.25))*(standard deviation of profits)

= (.675)*(0.67448975)* ($5755.91)

= +- $2,620.55.

The 50% confidence interval range is from ($10,683.61 + 2,620.55) to ($10,683.61 - $2,620.55).


15.Question 15

Question: With 99% confidence, what is the range of profitability?
1 / 1 point


Range from $20,691.32 to $675.90. *


Range from $19,388.27 to 10,683.61.


Range from $10,683.61 to -$8,704.31


Range from $16,388.27 to -$7,704.31

Correct
The mean of the interval is $10,683.61 (from Question 13).

The left-sided confidence interval is .5% or .005. The normsinv(p = .005)

= -2.575829304.

The interval from p= .005 to p = .995 is:

+- plus or minus

(the standard deviation of error as a fraction of the standard deviation of profits)*(normsinv(p = .005))*(standard deviation of profits)

= (.675)*(2.575829304)* ($5755.91)

= +- $10,007.71.

The range is from ($10,683.61 + $10,007.71)

to ($10,683.61 - $10,007.71).
